# Need to Implement

## StrokeStyle

## TruncateMode

## LayoutPriority

## PageWrap Padding

## VGrid


# Enhancements

## Image
?

## Columns
Self-Size for equal length columns.

## Grids
There should be more layout options.

## Shape
There are many intersection, union, etc functions that I have not yet implemented. Path is just a very thin layer
on top of MutablePath. I could just get rid of all of it and operate directly upon a MutablePath. Or, I could 
expose MutablePath.
