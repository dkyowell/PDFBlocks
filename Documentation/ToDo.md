# Need to Implement

## TextTruncateMode
Target: v0.4

## LayoutPriority
Target: v0.4


# Enhancements

## Text
wrap in a VStack

## Image
?

## Columns
Self-Size for equal length columns.

## Grids
There should be more layout options and a VGrid

## Shape
There are many intersection, union, etc functions that I have not yet implemented. Path is just a very thin layer
on top of MutablePath. I could just get rid of all of it and operate directly upon a MutablePath. Or, I could 
expose MutablePath.
