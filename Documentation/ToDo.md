#  To Do List

## Version 1.0 Roadmap

### VGrid


## Partialy Implmented
### PageWrap Text

### Column Layout

### Grids
There should be more layout options.

### Shape
There are many intersection, union, etc functions that I have not yet implemented. Path is just a very thin layer
on top of MutablePath. I could just get rid of all of it and operate directly upon a MutablePath. Or, I could 
expose MutablePath.
