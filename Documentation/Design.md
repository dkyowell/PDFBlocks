#  Project Design

## Issues
Padding within columns

## Roadmap

* Justified Text. This could be done poorly easily. Using NSText and hyphenation would give a better implementation;
* PageNumberReader to provide total pages. This will require a pre-pass.


## Longterm

Right to Left language support.

This project has been designed with the possiblity of a future cross platform implementation. The iOS/macOS implementation relies upon CoreGraphics and CoreText. I believe that Skia could provide the required functionality for a true cross platform implementation.
